# ADDENDUMS

On the first page: The gradient and shapes are not part of an image, they were made entirely with CSS! 

On the contact buttons/links: It tries to redirect you to your email client or copies my email for contact, because processing a form properly needs back-end code, which is not allowed to run in Github Pages. 

On the footer: The time to develop is the implementation time and includes testing, but it does not include making the mockup, prototyping, and text writing. The whole process (including repository testing and maintenance) took 2 months and a half, from mid-November (only in the weekends) to the end of January (from mid-December on, in the normal workdays). The first time in my logs that I did something related to this project is from December 24th, 2020; I made a bit of planning only, because I was still on school and was studying other things too. The second time is from October 17th, 2021; when I started doing some things in the project, but I created a 1 year plan about some studies and things I should do to prepare my way for when I finished school and could finally start making this project. I started making it for real around November 24th, 2022.

Extra: It has taken less than 100 hours to develop, probably even the whole process, which is better than what I expected and it could have taken less time to develop if I have not made the custom scroll behavior on the page. Testing things really took a lot of time, unfortunaly. 

This shows how long tests took (grayed-out lines are commented code, not working properly code)
