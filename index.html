<span class="mutable" id="work-state">up to help developing something</span>. I am a Full-Stack developer, I know the technologies that composes 
the web development. Well, I took it a step further by learning things about Linux, that I also like a lot, 
and even a bit of the C programming language! So, I even know about system maintenance and how to
setup a server, for instance. I have also gathered knowledge with scripting languages and desktop
program development. I speak <span class="mutable" id="languages">Portuguese, English and German</span>. The programming languages that I know 
and have had experience are: <span class="mutable" id="code-langs">Python, Shell Script, PHP, MySQL (MariaDB), Javascript, C and C++</span>.
And obviously I know HTML and CSS. I have at least did something with the following frameworks: 
Node.js, Vue.js, React-native, Electron and Expo. I can work with frameworks, but I actually do not like to
use them, because they are less stable than proven software like PHP or MySQL. I do not like to use OOP 
(Object Oriented Programming) paradigm of development, I prefer to use the function oriented programming,
I think it is easier to maintain and the code is more portable. I have background experiences and knowledge 
with tools like Git, Inkscape, Kdenlive and some others too. I am looking to make a better web and contribute
to a better desktop experience. I like to do software that makes people need to spend less time using it, 
by the way computers were created for this, for people to spend less time computing and doing calculations 
with data. I have some certifications, which appear below in the next section. And after it, I show some of my 
works and experiences. I have also categorized my works in four branches of development:     <span class="yellow">Front-end</span> sample, 
<span class="blue">back-end</span> sample,     <span class="green">scripting</span> sample and     <span class="red">native dev</span> sample. Where each one is represented by a different 
color as shown.</p>

                    <p>This is the first project I uploaded to GitHub. And I think it fits in the 
                        front-end branch. It was really cool to develop and testing it again I could
                        not resist changing parts of the code. It was also the first time I used
                        a JS framework, Electron, for the desktop version. In some of the next
                        repositories I make some comments about Electron. I saw a tutorial and
                        made it, applying the idea that I have had, adding gradients.
                        I thought I had a really nice idea and from it my sense of design began.
                        I started working with colors, what combinations were good, and so on.
                        From this repository, it is still possible to see how it was when I started
                        learning programming. I struggled to implement the pause button and
                        with the apple and tail overlap, but I think it has nice mechanics. 
                        I did not know about responsiveness, how to do a wiki, etc. But
                        I believe this is a nice game and a good start.</p>

                    <p>It is a mobile app. I made it using react-native and the Expo framework.
                        As explained in the repository, 'IMC' stands for 'BMI' in Portuguese.
                        When testing the app I could not run it, dependencies seem to be broken,
                        I could not build it also. And it showed some things to me. I am luck 
                        to have packaged a version. Handling dependencies with JS frameworks
                        was a mess, I even tried to use dependabot, but it proved to be really
                        hard to keep things safe and stable, a few months and it started throwing
                        errors. It was also implemented from a tutorial, my first mobile app, first
                        time using i18n for translations, and it even has an ad page! Beyond that,
                        if I am not wrong, you need an account to make a deploy, get things working
                        as they should in Expo. So, from my experience testing it, I would not 
                        recommend using react-native or Expo for developing a mobile application
                        with web technologies. If I had to, I would recommend Ionic.</p>

                    <p>This project shows well part of my learning process when I was starting my
                        web development studies. And I think this proves my blur effect enthusiasm.
                        Years later, I found a way to polyfill backdrop blur effect, but it still requires
                        the filter tag to work, if I am not wrong, I posted it to GitHub Gist. I believe
                        that the first version shows better my learning process than the revisited 
                        one, even that it might be a bit broken in comparison. It seems to be my first
                        project focusing only on a website. Because of it that this website is prettier
                        than the one I did for my mobile app, from when I started studying HTML,
                        CSS and JS without knowing what design was, just liking the entire concept.
                        I actually have started in Python, but liked a lot web technologies when I first
                        saw them, on a video from a guy implementing a beautiful login page. And I though
                        "What he can do with code! I want to try it too". Then I began my studies with it.</p>

                        when I realized it was hard to make a game and was not really my thing. After it,
                        I still tried to do something like a platform game, and made it with Gdevelop,
                        a engine that translates the work to JS, but never published it. Doing it,
                        I already had some notions about design, specially I got to know material 
                        design principles while doing this project. The sticky physics are too sticky.
                        And the game design is not the best, there is a nice shortcut there and just
                        one level. If I were to make a game today I would make the canvas responsive
                        and use proper implementations of real math and physics formulae to do
                        the physics of it. Still though I made the pixel art myself.</p>

                    <p>Well, another project with blur effect and based on a tutorial. My idea was to
                        simply add blur to the site. This really gave me insights on JS. When I made it,
                        I was still using the pseudo element method to achieve the effect. In this case,
                        it could be easily polyfilled to get backwards compatibility, but in the way it
                        was done still works nice. I made only small changes to it, so it is good to show
                        my learning process too. I probably made this one before the last one, but
                        apparently I created this repository after the repository from the last project.
                        The effect disappears when typing, I think it is not a really interesting function
                        for the user. It plays a bit with local storage using JS. And that is it.</p>

                    <p>This one is a modular script to install an i3, which is a window manager, a tile
                        system, in Linux Mint, which is a popular Linux OS. Linux Mint was the first
                        Linux  operating system that I used, it is considered by many as an easy to
                        use, to start using Linux. And i3 is also the entry point to the window manager
                        customization, specially to tiling window managers. They work by tiling the
                        windows pretty much like in the image. I do not feel like it is easier to start with.
                        but it was my first experience with this kind of window managers. The thing is
                        some people consider them to be more optimal and better to use. At the end,
                        the benefits are not so high for me, I was not used to it. And, I did not know how
                        to do it right. More about it, I speak in the penultimate project. Maybe it will stop
                        working in the future, I did many adjustments in it. But it is stable and the first
                        register that I studied Bash, a scripting language to interact with the OS, and
                        about OSs, distributions. With it, I could setup an entire environment quickly,
                        beyond setting only the web server, which I was yet to study deeper.</p>

                        is in one of the sections below, this project is the true FullStack one. I created this
                        because then I was already using servers and studying back-end code, and
                        realized that I always had to create an index.html for the server, to start testing
                        my PHP code. So, I made this preset of an index.html to not need to create it and
                        to avoid having errors in the server. I started using the Apache Server for my
                        studies and I still like using and setting it up. Also, I made it in a way I can put
                        links directly into the HTML page, this way I can access routes more easily. I had
                        a bit of a concernment about images, so I designed the image myself and got a
                        free icon. This was a fun project to make.</p>

                        last section, I used some of the color palettes from here in the background image
                        I made in the other project. I started using and searching colors, then I decided to
                        create my own set of colors, all colors in the website come from the palettes and my
                        searches, it even has attributions from the places I gathered them. In the page I put
                        just the primary colors palette and the gradients, the other palettes I organized in
                        a package. As I liked a lot neon colors, and most of them are neon colors, I named it
                        "neon palette". I completely remake the usability of the page, to copy colors
                        more easily and to be a bit more responsive. A bit about CSS frameworks, I do not know
                        much about them, the one  I got the closest was Bootstrap, but I never really used it.
                        My favorite framework in this case is Tailwind, I even included the Tailwind v1 colors
                        in my extended palette. I think I could use it, because it is close to pure CSS, the
                        colors are great too, one of the best frameworks.</p>

                    <p>It is the back-end sample part of the project I talked about earlier. It is really simple,
                        but nice. Here I wrote a better wiki, on how to setup it. I used md5 to store the
                        passwords just because it is an example, using md5 algorithm in practice is not secure.
                        Strangely enough, when you mix PHP code with HTML, GitHub considers it to be Hack,
                        an implementation of PHP made by Metaâ„¢. This is the first back-end focused repository
                        I made. I seems that I can do more writing less with PHP and MySQL, in my case MariaDB,
                        which is free. So, it appears that I did not use it much, but I like it a lot. These languages
                        are really stable and safe for their purposes. The only thing that could reach close, be
                        interesting enough using, is Phoenix, an Elixir framework focused in scalability,
                        at least in my opinion.</p>

                    <p>This project was made for when I used Virtualbox VM. Now I prefer QEMU, and I discovered recently
                        that doing it is not really necessary with Virtualbox. I originally created this script to
                        change the screen resolution inside a virtual machine, my place to test out many things,
                        mainly new window managers and desktop interfaces that I have discovered. It usually failed to have
                        a resolution that fit nice for me (higher Xorg resolution on smaller screen). Changing the resolution
                        was difficult and did not work well. The script works in a bit technical way, it calls tools of the
                        system that handles the display server, the classic case in Linux, Xorg, and tells specific instructions
                        to the server to resize the resolution to a new custom one, something that is really powerful and nice to
                        see working. Still though it worked a little different in every environment and desktop, that I used it,
                        specially the behavior of the fixscreen.sh script generated. A different project, but nice at some degree.</p>

                    <p>It is a nice one. Here I managed to get a Qt application, which is a native framework for making
                        user interfaces, working with web technologies without Electron. Qt is a really powerful framework
                        in this subject and is well-known, I think it is even possible to design mobile applications with it.
                        I made a window with transparency settings, used the WebKit embedded browser, and done, I
                        can use HTML, CSS and JS between other technologies looking native with this nice effect and it
                        is not so memory consuming. If you try it, just pay attention to the dependencies, I had forgotten to
                        list them. I could make an entire web application that fits in the desktop and play around with it,
                        like if it was a normal application, with the stability and powers of this framework. What a solution! I think.</p>

                        desktop environments. The script is to install a theme, desktop customization, made by another
                        person. So I gathered the steps and the extra configuration files necessary, and created the install
                        script. I did some improvements to the theme too. I think it may not work in the future. These things
                        change a lot too, and seeing it again, I realized that this just works specifically with some specific
                        tools and with specific distributions of Linux, Arch-Based distributions, in this case. And it is not really
                        good. The most portable script is the one that installs the Dosis font, and it is not still as portable
                        as it could be. A bit about my researches, I should have written about it before, I have complains with
                        all the window managers I tested; Openbox is one close to what I am used to, but while configuring
                        things problems appear. However, I think this was a step towards the right direction and that I had improvements.</p>

                        the original repository got abandoned or it was completed. I think my changes could be merged, however it
                        seems unlikely to happen. And this was my experience trying to work together mainly. I did this to improve the
                        customization experience of the plug-in, which is for the Hyper.js terminal, a terminal application based on web
                        technologies, it uses Electron. The plug-in really makes it more beautiful in my opinion and I had an idea of
                        improvement, it changes the window buttons in a customizable way, to these little circles. And I thought of adding
                        the possibility to customize the visibility of the title and of the hamburger menu too, each one separately. With it,
                        the terminal can be like the code displays that people do with mockups of terminals, that makes you focus on the code
                        with a nice interface, in a real environment.</p>

                    <p>It is a homepage for the browser that I made already with an idea of a portfolio, the one you are seeing now. It has
                        options to add more websites to the grid and to remove, which are all implemented just in the front-end without
                        frameworks, for me this is incredible. It was a lot of work, but was fun to do. And now I know it is possible with only
                        default CSS and JS. There are many functions, to change the background image, change the grid size, and more.
                        The default items are not entirely my preferences, but between them there are real recommendations I would do.
                        At this point, I realized that I was still better and had a lot of fun at front-end development, more than in other
                        things I was studying and using, and also the programming language I had more fun was PHP. I really like it.</p>

                    <p>This is a theme that I made with the knowledge I have gathered through my studies. Because it is done with CSS,
                        I will still consider it as a front-end sample. It was an idea I had while doing my customizations, configurations, and
                        I think it is really beautiful. It supports the two major desktop environments in Linux, KDE and Gnome. There are many
                        inconsistencies and I can not have something as simple as windows with blur effect in all window elements, like
                        panels, titlebars, rounded corners and a simple border around it all. And I do not have the necessary knowledge to
                        change it, not only the C or C++ should be known, but also how their software structures work. When doing it, I was
                        already doing things for my personal use, which I show in the next section. I encountered problems and I even tried
                        to patch the code, do changes, but it did not work. I worked with what I knew, mostly the CSS part. I think it is
                        a nice theme, good colors on eye, between other aspects.</p>

                    <p>Finally, this is the result of the desktop part of my studies. I even made a theme customization for my personal
                        settings, which is what dotfiles mean. To do it, CSS knowledge is needed, so I used much of what I studied and I
                        like it a lot. And it is still the closest I get from the experience of blur effect and rounded corners that I have
                        talked earlier, I mean in a more consistent way, not consistent enough yet, this may change soon. I applied many nice
                        concepts to create my own configurations. This project targets the usability for production and some other technical
                        goals, and a bit of the history is available in the repository. It is not completed yet, I plan to add a whole side bar with
                        widgets and a top menu bar with many functionalities, to speed up some processes. If it were not the need for the blur
                        effect I probably could have a more refined experience in some Linux environments than I would in MacOS, and that is
                        awesome. In other words this is a backup, and more of a weekend project now, just a hobby, a useful one.</p>

                    <p>At last, this is my favorite tiling window manager. And I created this repository to save this specific part of my researches
                        and studies, something that I did before even starting my dotfiles project. It is a nice extra as I can not work really well
                        without desktop environments. So I do not use it daily. I admit that I focused on studying other things more than web
                        technologies for a while, however I think that everything I learned really is useful for me, directly or indirectly. I feel that
                        I gained efficiency; experience in how to improve the usability of an application, how to build it in a cohesive way;
                        knowledge about how to setup a system; and more. By the way, exploring things like this is powerful, it is from there that
                        things like having the theme colors matching the wallpaper that Android and others use now.</p>
